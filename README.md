# pseudocharacters

This project is an exploration of generatively creating asemic characters using [p5.js]("https://p5js.org/") and [canvas-sketch]("https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/").

## Concept

The concept was originally for me to be able to create an entire alphabet of asemic characters, and have each generated character mapped to a specific character so that whenever I typed a character on my keyboard it would be mapped to a generative character in the alphabet that would be defined by a certain set of rules. Some kind of more abstract encoding of a character other than the space it takes up/the picture it creates.

## Future Plans and Thoughts

- different bases for characters to control and format strokes
- Add different strokes
- Make parameters more configurable from UI
- Introduce more variability in characters that have the same configuration
- Nail down parameters for scaling and spacing the characters to allow for typing and the creation of asemic passages instead of individual characters
- Adapt for Pen plotter
