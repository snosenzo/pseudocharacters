# pseudocharacters
This project is an exploration of generatively creating asemic characters using [p5.js]("https://p5js.org/") and canvas-sketch.

##Concept
The concept was originally for me to be able to create an entire alphabet of asemic characters, and have each generated character mapped to a specific character so that whenever I typed a 
character on my keyboard it would be mapped to a generative character in the alphabet that would be defined by a certain set of rules. Some kind of more abstract encoding of a character other than the space it takes up/the picture it creates.
